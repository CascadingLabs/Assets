# Contributing to {{PROJECT_NAME}}

Thanks for your interest in contributing to {{PROJECT_NAME}}! This guide covers how to get set up and what we expect from pull requests.

## Objectives

{{OBJECTIVES}}

## Clone & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CascadingLabs/{{REPO_NAME}}.git
cd {{REPO_NAME}}
bun install
```

**Prerequisites:**

| Tool | Version | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| Bun | >= 1.3.11 | [bun.sh](https://bun.sh) |

### Install pre-commit hooks

```bash
uvx prek install
```

[Prek](https://github.com/thesuperzapper/prek) is a Rust-based pre-commit runner that executes git hooks automatically on every `git commit`, catching issues before they reach CI. It reads the same `.pre-commit-config.yaml` format. In this repo the hooks run Biome (lint + format), check for secrets via gitleaks, and enforce conventional commit messages via commitizen. To run all hooks manually:

```bash
uvx prek run --all-files
```

### Run the dev server

```bash
bun run dev
```

### Build

```bash
bun run build
```

## Linting & Formatting

We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) for linting and formatting. The config lives in `biome.json`.

**Key rules:**

- Tab indentation, 80-char line width
- Single quotes, trailing commas, semicolons
- No unused imports (error), no unused variables (warn)
- Sorted Tailwind classes enforced via `useSortedClasses`
- Some rules relaxed for `.astro` files (see `biome.json` overrides)

### Commands

```bash
# Lint
bun run lint

# Format
bun run format

# Lint + format (auto-fix)
bun run check
```

CI runs `biome check` on every push and PR. Your PR must pass this check.

## Pull Request Rules

1. **Branch from `main`** — create a feature branch (`feat/...`, `fix/...`, `docs/...`).
2. **Keep PRs focused** — one logical change per PR.
3. **Pass CI** — Biome check and build must succeed.
4. **Describe your changes** — every PR should include:
   - **Intent** — what the PR does and why.
   - **Changes** — a summary of what was changed.
   - **GenAI usage** — if you used AI to write any of the code, include the prompts you used.
   - **Risks** — any risks or side effects this PR might introduce.

### Commit Conventions

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add new component
fix: correct layout issue on mobile
docs: update README with deployment steps
```
